Developed a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS, showcasing my skills, experience, and projects. Key sections include a dynamic header with name and tagline, an About section with a bio and photo, and a Skills area listing key expertise. The Projects section highlights samples of my work with titles and descriptions, while the Resume section provides a downloadable link. The Contact section includes direct communication options, and a professional footer ties it all together. This portfolio is designed to provide an organized, accessible overview of my work and qualifications
